# activemq-drainer

__Note: This was built to run against ActiveMQ version 5.11.0.redhat-621084. Because that was the latest version of Red Hat AMQ 6.3 that was released at the time of this writing. If you are operating against a newer/different version of ActiveMQ (community edition or otherwise), simply change the `activemq.version` property in the pom.xml to match the version of the ActiveMQ broker that you are draining from.__
